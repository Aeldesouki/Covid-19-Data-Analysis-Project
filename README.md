The course materials belong entirely to Coursera. Also, the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University. These files only show my own personal work on data analysis.
Great thanks to the course instructor: Ahmad Varasteh

Goal: Merge the two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country, and create a visual worldwide map to show Covid-19 infection densities in various countries.
